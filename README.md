### Implementation
* The dataset I use has > 5000 samples.
* Using LSTM in a model architecture.
* Using a sequential model.
* The validation set is 20% of the total dataset.
* Using a sequential model.
* Using Embedding.
* Using the tokenizer function.
* Using the Learning Rate in the Optimizer.
* Has the accuracy of the model 98%.
* MAE <10% of data scale.


## Steps
1. Install the modules required based on the type of implementation.
2. Download the dataset you want to train and predict your system with (weather data)
3. Train your data using Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/)
